# Algorithms and Data Structures
Some of my tests and analysis done during "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python" course

### Dictionary and list speed comparison
Experiment idea:
1. make list with a range numbers in it
2. pick random number and check if is in the list
3. repeat for dictionary (numbers as keys)

Results:

### List speed
Speed comparison of:
- concat
- append
- comprehension
- list range
- pop:
  -  pop first
  -  pop last 

Results:  
Nothing unexpected except one thing. I expected pop(0) to be O(n) and pop(1) -> O(1), while it looks like both are O(1). To check.

### **Stack**
Stack implementation - stack class ("list like") witk some basic methods.  
stack_bin_to_dec - practical test od Stack class. Function conwerting decimal numbers to "any-base" number.

### **Queue**
Queue implementation - queue class ("list like") witk some basic methods.  
queue_printer_simulator - practical test od Stack class. (Not finished yet)
